<code>D:\Software\&#x00a0;OnStart</code>,  
the name of the folder is OnStart, and it starts with <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>0160</kbd> which is <code>\u00A0</code>,  
<strong>NOT A SPACE</strong> but a valid transparent character I use to put important folders on top of A-Z-sorted lists.  

On Lenovo you need to activate "numlock" mode with <kbd>FN</kbd>+<kbd>ScrLk(NmLk)</kbd> first (and then turn it off after you are done).  

the decimal value of the character is 160 (which is why you type <code>0160</code> to get it).  
in order to perserve it in HTML I use a hex-HTML entity <code>&amp;#x00a0;</code>,  
should work on copy/paste as well...

<h1>Be Aware! Some Are Tryout, Some Can Seriously Break Your System, for example <code>AHCIIDE-Starter</code> seems like a good idea but it loads up a lot of drivers you don't need and will make your computer very slow. and <code>--_Automated Windows Update Fix</code> was working fine on XP but I stil find sometimes wrong with it and fix it. This folder does not describe history, and from time to time everything will be force push to clean up stack.</h1>

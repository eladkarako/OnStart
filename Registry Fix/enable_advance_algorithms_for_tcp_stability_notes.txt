Receive-Side Scaling (RSS)
  A Microsoft Windows feature on some supported network-controllers (not a built-in TCP-feature).
  The network-controller will dynamically load-balances inbound network connections across multiple processors or cores (of the computer's CPU)

TCP Chimney Offload (TOE)
  A Microsoft Windows feature on some supported network-controllers (not a built-in TCP-feature).
  TCP traffic processing of the entire TCP/IP stack is moved from the the computer CPU, to the network-controller.

  Automatic
    offloading only if 
    1. The connection is established through a 10-Gbps Ethernet adapter.
    2. The mean round-trip link latency is less than 20 milliseconds.
    3. At least 130 KB of data have been exchanged over the connection.
    
    In Automatic mode, the TCP receive window is set to 16 MB.
    NOTE: Because the Windows stack (CPU) has better performance optimizations, 
          that are not found in Chimney-capable network adapters, 
          Automatic mode restricts offloads only to those connections that might receive the most benefit from it.
 
  Enabled
    offloads the processing for connections on a first-come, first-served basis.

  Disabled
    all network processing is done on the CPU.
